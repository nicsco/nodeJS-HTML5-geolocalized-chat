# 🌍 GeoLocal Chat

A simple geolocalized real-time chat application built with **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, **Redis**, and browser-based **Geolocation**.

Users are automatically placed into chat rooms based on their approximate latitude and longitude. Each room corresponds to a geographic region, allowing localized conversations.


## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Location-based chat rooms
- 💬 Real-time messaging using WebSockets
- 🔄 Redis pub/sub for message distribution
- 📱 Mobile-friendly UI
- 🎨 Simple and elegant frontend with chat bubbles
- 💡 Context-aware messages based on coordinates


## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Socket.IO, Redis
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery
- **Location API**: HTML5 Geolocation API


## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geolocal-chat.git
   cd geolocal-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Make sure Redis is installed and running**

    ```bash
    # Install Redis (if not already installed)
    sudo apt-get install redis-server

    # Start Redis
    redis-server
    ```

4. **Start the server**

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

5. **Visit in your browser**

    ```js
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

## 🌍 How It Works

- When a user loads the page, the browser asks for their location.
- Latitude and longitude are rounded and used as a chat room ID (e.g. `419,125`).
- All users within the same location area share a chat room.
- Messages are sent using Socket.IO and distributed with Redis pub/sub.
- The UI updates in real time, with messages styled as "me" or "other" depending on the sender.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Global `room` variable may cause cross-client interference (improvement in progress).
- No message sanitization (XSS protection is recommended).
- Creates a Redis client per user — may be inefficient at scale.

## ✅ To Do

- [ ] Replace Redis per-client subscriptions with Socket.IO native rooms
- [ ] Sanitize incoming/outgoing message content
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness and auto-scroll
