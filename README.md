BEGINNINGS
==========
When I wanted to learn websocket protocol, as I have always done I haven’t only study the theory, but I have tried to apply it. The first thing that came in my mind was a chat. And, because in that time I was also working on geolocated content, I asked myself: why don’t make (another, but mine) geolocated chat software? There it is!



INSTRUCTION
===========
TBD :)


Warning: I have upload my old code... I'm not sure it will work, so re-read it :)
